Brief documentation for React Application


I implemented a simple Gems Catalog web site to tested my React proficiency.
I used some external librries - Bootstrap 4, Toastr, Uuid, font-awesome, fortawesome, jQuery, SweetAlert, openweather-apis and SASS.
The  application has a public part that gives a global idea for the site and sign-in, sign-up sections.
All authentication users has access to all gems and store them in their private room. 
If he collected three gems of one type, he can upgrade to jewel from this category and loose the gems after that and all this is repeated as you collect all the jewels.
If yu have such jewelry they become public for all registered users and they can write a comment about them and give a rating.
Administrative sections can create, edit and delete gems, jewelry and comments, 
they can also monitor all users and see their full information and can edit their profile for violations to block or permanently erase them from the base.
